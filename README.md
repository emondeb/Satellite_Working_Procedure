# Satellite_Working_Procedure
It is a Computer Graphics mini Project which is made by using OpenGL.
 
The main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts of working of a Satellite in OpenGL. This project demonstrates how signals are transmitted and received to and from a satellite. We know a Satellite is an object which has been placed into orbit by human. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as the Moon. To differentiate between objects we have used different colors for different objects. In this project a small SolidCube was used to represent a data, which travels as data transfer from source to destination.
